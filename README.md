## Usage
Clone the repository, and run in the main directory:
- npm run install
- npm run build
- npm run server
And then run on your own computer using localhost:3000

## What I Learned:
I learned about the webpack, mainfest files and the indexedDB. I also learned that there is something called code mirror which is pretty cool, and I looked into it and it seems to be very customizable. 

## Sucesses:
Something that I had sucess were getting the header into the text editor, which I thought would have been harder to do then it was. And 

## Difficulties:
What I had the most difficutly with was getting the application to start. There must be at least 3 unnecessary packets in the package.json file because I was just trying everything and kept recieving errors on it, in the end it was something that I had put inside of the manifest file.
